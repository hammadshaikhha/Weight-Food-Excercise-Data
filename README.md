# Purpose
This repository includes my personal data on weight, diet and exercise during a time period where I lost close to 40 pounds in around 5 months from adapting a fitness oriented life style. Prior to integrating exercise  and healthier eating into my daily routine, I had a very sedentary life style where walking from University buildings was my main form of exercise. 

My data is a example of an average sedentary untrained overweight male transitioning into a healthier and more fit person over time. My height is 5 ft 8 and my year of birth is 1992. 

[I have also uploaded a video on youtube illustrating the weight loss journey related to this data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrB7FkOWxvI&feature=youtu.be)


# Description of Data

The data consists of daily time series of weight, waist size, food consumption, and exercise from May 2019 and onwards. Summary statistics of key variables is shown below:

![Summary Statistics](/Figures/SummaryStatistics.png)

The range column suggests that I lost around 40 lbs, reduced my waist by almost 7 inches, and BMI by around 6 points. I eat around 2 high calorie plates of food a day (lunch and dinner) and usually exercise for 50 minutes a day.

I started dieting from July - November and then eating more to maintain my weight at around 145 lbs. My weight (lbs) and waist size (inches) throughout this fitness journey is shown below.

Given that weight can largely fluctuate when studied at the daily level, the following Figure illustrates a more stable time series of mean weights across months.

The above Table and Figures can be replicated using WeightAnalysis.do. Feel free to use the data WeightWaistFoodExcercise.csv to do your own analysis in your favourite programming language. 

# Progress Pictures
Since pictures can vary greatly depending on lighting, clothing, hairstyle, camera filters, and many others factors, it can be hard to attribute changes in pictures across time mainly to dieting and exercise. In attempts to make apples-apple comparison, I took a few pictures in a controlled lighting environment, wearing the same clothes, and with the same camera with no filters.

# Mindset
Although I am no expert in weight loss or fitness (i.e. no formal academic training) I imagine some people may benefit from knowing my mindset during this weight loss journey:
* I made small changes over time to my regular routine (jump roping and cutting out junk food) to transition into a healthier one.
* I didn't implement popular online weight loss tips that I didn't think were sustainable or worked with my schedule.
* Weight/fat loss is not that complicated. Its as simple as eating less and moving more holding other factors constant.
* My goals were based on moderate progression in weight loss and consistency in exercise rather than achieving a certain weight/physique at some future date.

# Repository Contribution Opportunities 
If you collected similar data over your fitness journey then consider adding it here. The repository can also benefit from additional analysis done on this data (e.g. important factors that contribute to weight loss).
