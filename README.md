# Purpose
This repository includes my personal data on weight, diet and exercise during a time period where I lost close to 40 pounds in around 5 months from adapting a fitness oriented life style. Prior to integrating exercise  and healthier eating into my daily routine, I had a very sedentary life style where walking from University buildings was my main form of exercise. 

My data is a example  of an average sedentary untrained overweight male transitioning into a healthier and more fit person over time. My height is 5 ft 8 and my year of birth is 1992.
