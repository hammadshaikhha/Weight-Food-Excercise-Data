# Purpose
This repository includes my personal data on weight, diet and exercise during a time period where I lost close to 40 pounds in around 5 months from adapting a fitness oriented life style. Prior to integrating exercise  and healthier eating into my daily routine, I had a very sedentary life style where walking from University buildings was my main form of exercise. 

My data is a example  of an average sedentary untrained overweight male transitioning into a healthier and more fit person over time. My height is 5 ft 8 and my year of birth is 1992. 

# Description of Data

The data consists of daily time series of weight, waist size, food consumption, and exercise from May 2019 and onwards. Summary statistics of key variables is shown below:

![Summary Statistics](/Figures/SummaryStatistics.png)

The range column suggests that I lost around 40 lbs and reduced my BMI by almost 7 points. I eat around 2 high calorie plates of food a day (lunch and dinner) and usually exercise for 50 minutes a day.

I started dieted from July - November and then eating more to maintain my weight at around 145 lbs. My weight (lbs) and waist size (inches) throughout this fitness journey is shown below.

Given that weight can largely fluctuate when studied at the daily level, the following Figure illustrates a more stable time series on mean weights across months.

The above Table and Figures can be replicated using WeightAnalysis.do. Feel free to use the data WeightWaistFoodExcercise.csv to do your analysis in your favourite programming language. 

# Progress Pictures
Since pictures can vary greatly depending on lighting, clothing, hairstyle, camera filters, and many others factors, it can be hard to attribute changes in pictures across time mainly to dieting and exercise. In attempts to make apples-apple comparison over, I took a few pictures in a controlled lighting environment, wearing the same clothes, and with the same camera with no filters.
